# ATARI

### Control notes
The Atari is foreign to our pampered minds.
Basically, it hates you when you start it up.
The Atari has buttons we're not used to having, including a
"select game" button and a "reset" button. For Space Invaders, these buttons
are used to first select a difficulty (select game) and then start the game
(reset).

When the game is started, a difficulty must be selected and then the game must
be reset.

Holding down the "select game" button will continually increase the difficult.
Alex has shown that he sucks at Space Invaders and can barely beat the first
stage. Our agent will probably have similar difficulty.

### Midterm deliverables
Table of scores versus type of agent, e.g. no movement, random movement,
handmade policy, human.
